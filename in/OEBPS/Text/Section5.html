  <h2>Authors’ Note</h2>

  <p>This book is the companion volume to <i>Anti-Oedipus</i> (paperback ed., University of Minnesota Press, 1983).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Together they make up <i>Capitalism and Schizophrenia.</i></p>

  <p>It is composed not of chapters but of “plateaus.” We will try to explain why later on (and also why the texts are dated). To a certain extent, these plateaus may be read independently of one another, except the conclusion, which should be read at the end.</p>
