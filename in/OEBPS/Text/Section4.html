  <h2>Notes on the Translation and&nbsp;<span>Acknowledgments</span></h2>

  <p><span class="calibre9">AFFECT/AFFECTION</span>. Neither word denotes a personal feeling <i>(sentiment</i> in Deleuze and Guattari). <i>L‘affect</i> (Spinoza’s <i>affectus)</i> is an ability to affect and be affected. It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or diminution in that body’s capacity to act. <i>L’affection</i> (Spinoza’s <i>affectio)</i> is each such state considered as an encounter between the affected body and a second, affecting, body (with body taken in its broadest possible sense to include “mental” or ideal bodies).</p>

  <p><span class="calibre9">DRAW</span>. In <i>A Thousand Plateaus,</i> to draw is an act of creation. What is drawn (the Body without Organs, the plane of consistency, a line of flight) does not preexist the act of drawing. The French word <i>tracer</i> captures this better: It has all the graphic connotations of “to draw” in English, but can also mean to blaze a trail or open a road. “To trace” (<i>decalquer),</i> on the other hand, is to copy something from a model.</p>

  <p><span class="calibre9">FLIGHT/ESCAPE</span>. Both words translate <i>fuite,</i> which has a different range of meanings than either of the English terms. <i>Fuite</i> covers not only the act of fleeing or eluding but also flowing, leaking, and disappearing into the distance (the vanishing point in a painting is <i>a point de fuite).</i> It has no relation to flying. MILIEU. In French, <i>milieu</i> means “surroundings,” “medium” (as in chemistry), and “middle.” In the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari, “milieu” should be read as a technical term combining all three meanings.</p>

  <p><span class="calibre9">PLANE</span>. The word <i>plan</i> designates both a “plane” in the geometrical sense and a “plan.” The authors use it primarily in the first sense. Where both meanings seem to be present (as in discussions of <i>the, plan d’organisatori)</i> “plan(e)” has been used in the translation.</p>

  <p><span>POWER</span>. Two words for “power” exist in French, <i>puissance</i> and <i>pouvoir.</i> In Deleuze and Guattari, they are associated with very different concepts (although the terminological distinction is not consistently observed). <i>Puissance</i> refers to a range of potential. It has been defined by Deleuze as a “capacity for existence,” “a capacity to affect or be affected,” a capacity to multiply connections that may be realized by a given “body” to varying degrees in different situations. It may be thought of as a scale of intensity or fullness of existence (or a degree on such a scale), analogous to the capacity of a number to be raised to a higher “power.” It is used in the French translation of Nietzsche’s term “will to power.” Like its English counterpart, it has an additional mathematical usage, designating the number of elements in a finite or infinite set. Here, <i>puissance</i> pertains to the virtual (the plane of consistency), <i>pouvoir</i> to the actual (the plane of organization). The authors <i>use pouvoir</i> in a sense very close to Foucault’s, as an instituted and reproducible relation of force, a selective concretization of potential. Both <i>puissance</i> and <i>pouvoir</i> have been translated here as “power,” since the distinction between the concepts is usually clear from the context. The French terms have been added in parentheses where confusion might arise, and in occasional passages where <i>puissance</i> is rendered as “potential.”</p>

  <p><span class="calibre9">PROCESS/PROCEEDING</span>. The authors employ two words normally translated as “process.” <i>Processus</i> in their usage is the more general of the two, covering both the stratified and destratified dimensions of an occurrence. <i>Proces</i> pertains only to the stratification. In standard French, <i>proces</i> also means “trial” (as in the title of the Kafka novel). Deleuze and Guattari exploit this polysemy as a way of emphasizing the role of organizations of social power and regimes of signs in operations constitutive of the subject, or <i>proces de subjectivation. Proces</i> is usually (once again, there is slippage in their usage) translated as “proceeding,” despite the occasional awkwardness this produces in English, in an attempt to preserve both associations: a process, or way of proceeding, and a legal proceeding, or trial. <i>Processus</i> is always “process.”</p>

  <p><span>SELF</span><span>. Both</span> <i>Moi</i> <span>and</span> <i>Soi</i> <span>have usually been translated as “Self,” with the French in brackets.</span> <i>Soi</i> <span>is the self in its broadest sense, but as a neuter third-person pronoun implies an impersonality at the basis of the self.</span> <i>Moi</i> <span>is a more restricted concept: the “me” as subject of enunciation for the “I”</span> <i>(je)</i> <span>as subject of the statement. It is also the French term for the Freudian ego.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p>SIGNIFIANCE/INTERPRETANCE. I have followed the increasingly common practice of importing <i>signifiance</i> and <i>interpr’etance</i> into English without modification. In Deleuze and Guattari these terms refer respectively to the syntagmatic and paradigmatic processes of language as a “signifying regime of signs.” They are borrowed from Benveniste (“signifying capacity” and “interpretative capacity” are the English translations used in Benveniste’s work).</p>

  <p><span class="calibre9">STATEMENT</span>. <i>Enonce</i> (often “utterance”) has been translated here as “statement,” in keeping with the choice of the English translators of Foucault, to whose conception Deleuze and Guattari’s is closest. “Enunciation” is used for <i>enonciation.</i></p>

  <p>TRAIT. The word <i>trait</i> has a range of meanings not covered by any single word in English. Literally, it refers to a graphic drawing, and to the act of drawing a line. Abstractly, it is the purely graphic element. Figuratively, it is an identifying mark (a feature, or trait in the English sense), or any act constituting a mark or sign. In linguistics, “distinctive features” <i>(traits distinctifs</i> or <i>traits pertinents)</i> are the elementary units of language that combine to form a phoneme. <i>Trait</i> also refers to a projectile, especially an arrow, and to the act of throwing a projectile. Here, “trait” has been retained in all but narrowly linguistic contexts.</p>

  <p><span class="calibre9">GENDER-BIASED USAGE</span> has been largely eliminated through plural-ization or the use of male and female pronouns. However, where Deleuze and Guattari seem deliberately to be using “man” to designate a socially constructed, patriarchal standard of human behavior applied to both men and women, the masculine generic has been retained.</p>
